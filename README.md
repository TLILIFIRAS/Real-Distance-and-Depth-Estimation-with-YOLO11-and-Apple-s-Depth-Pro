# Real-Distance-and-Depth-Estimation-with-YOLO11-and-Apple-s-Depth-Pro
In this project, I developed a solution to estimate the real depth of objects using a single camera and the YOLO11 model. The approach leverages Apple's Depth Pro model for accurate metric depth estimation, combined with object detections from YOLO11 by Ultralytics.
